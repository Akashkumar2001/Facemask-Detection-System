# Facemask-Detection-System
A deep learning project, based on Convolutional Neural Network(CNN), to identify whether a person has weared a proper mask and that too in a proper way or not.  This system can be very handy to use at public places, to detect people who are not wearing the mask, and thereby required actions could be taken.
